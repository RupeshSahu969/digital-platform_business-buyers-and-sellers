## Project Overview
A React + TailwindCSS single-page application that simulates Caprae Capital’s platform for connecting business buyers and sellers. The app includes:
- Separate buyer & seller onboarding flows
- Buyer discovery cards (Accept / Reject)
- Matched workflow with a 4-step acquisition process
- AI-like Financial Document Analyzer UI (simulated)
- Clean, approachable UI and routing (Signup → Onboarding → Discovery → Matched)

This codebase demonstrates front-end engineering skills, UI/UX design, and product thinking for M&A workflows.
